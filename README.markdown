## Calendar Script

This script downloads the different computer science calendars from
calendar.au.dk/cal.php and parses the data that it recives, so that it can be
used to find a free room ASAP.

### Feature requests and bugs

* The script should use some sort of cacheing instead of parsing the data for each request
* The html page sould use the json service to get the data, for nice ajax feel
